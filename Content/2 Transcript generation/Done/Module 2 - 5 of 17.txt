That you've learned linux file system it's time to learn basic linux comments that you can execute in a command line interface to work with that far system to create folders files to display the information in your system etc.
[22840,30660]
So first of all obviously restart we the graphical user interface which is everything that you see right here.
[31150,39750]
It's visual it's graphical and is a user is a simple starting point to interact with your operating system.
[40090,48840]
You can open up the kitchens year you can install new applications you can create new folders new files etc.
[49720,69600]
And everything that you can do even graphical user interface you can also do in a command line interface and have the kitchen for displaying and working with command line interface is called a terminal which just like all these other applications year is also an application which we can't okay.
[69400,72630]
Then the number system and i'm actually gonna.
[74140,93540]
Move this unnecessary stuff here so that we have that right on display so graphical user interface and camilla interface are basically two different interfaces that we as operating system users interact with the operating system and on personal computers.
[93250,113760]
And laptops usually kept vote on servers you would get a camilla interface and know graphical user interface and that's why is it devolves engineer since you're going to be working with servers you need to have the skill and we need to know how to work week camilla interface however as.
[113410,125760]
We're going to see this as we go along working with commemorate interface also on your personal computer or laptop can actually be more convenient than just using the graphical user interface.
[126610,128280]
So let's get started with it.
[128920,136530]
Personal what you see here is something called a terminal window so we have a terminal application here.
[137350,146550]
And just like you have browser tips or browser windows you have terminal windows and you can open as many of them as you want.
[148030,160050]
In right here you see a live with a bunch of a permission first one here is the name of the linux user that is currently.
[160780,171270]
Logged in and using this terminal i'm not been as a user nadeau and that's why i actually see that information in the terminal the second part here.
[171850,184290]
This stream is the computer knee so whatever your computer is cold if it hasn't automatically generated name or something that you named yourself you will see that information right here.
[184600,204450]
And with personal computers obviously mostly you would know these however when you're logging into a server that's actually pretty convenient to know exactly which machine you're on and which user you are logged in as suffer a server this actually will be a host name of that computer.
[204963,219960]
So in sarah environments when you're doing stuff on multiple different servers and you may have ten different servers open it's important to keep track on which computer you are executing different stuff.
[220302,225900]
In the after that we have these characters here called killed break.
[226750,229230]
Killed is actually a short cut.
[229900,241500]
To a home directory of the user i'm in my nana users home directory and that's the has sort of say to my home which is this character.
[242140,252720]
And then we have dollar sign which means that you're working as a regular user on a operating system you're not a super user you're a regular user.
[253270,273300]
If you're lugging as a rookie user and executing men's as route then this will be a cold side is that of the dollar sign and again all these is very practical when working on several machines at once so that you don't forget and get confused or what status is on each of those servers.
[274000,282510]
Great so this is actually an interface where you write comments for a computer to execute.
[283210,289440]
So instead of creating a folder here you would write a comment for a computer to create a folder.
[306609,307109]
Just.
